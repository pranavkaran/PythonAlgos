Get number of customers who placed orders in last 3 months

select count(*) from Customer_info where customer_id in (select distinct customer_id from order_info where order_date between getDate() and getDate(-3))


 

J : How would you provide a list of customers names with >$10k in total purchase over the last 30 days?

select customer_name from Customer_info where customer_id in (select distinct customer_id, sum(order_amout) from order_info where order_date between getDate() and getDate(-1) and sum(order_amount) > 10,000)


select c.customer_name, sum(o.order_info) from customer_info c inner join order_info o
on c.customer_id = o.customer.id 
where order_date between getDate() and getDate(-1) and sum(order_amout) > 10,000 
group by cusmoter_id


Write a method: Given an array of integers "intArray", and a specific integer "k", return the number of times "k" appears in "intArray".
EX: intArray = [7,5,9,1,5,5,7,6,5], k = 5, return value = 4.

def(intArray, k):
    cnt = {}
    varCount = 0
    if len(intArray) > 0:
        for i in intArray:
            if i == k:
                varCount += 1
            if i in cnt:
              cnt[i] += 1
            else:
                cnt[i] = 1
        # return varCount
        return cnt[k] 
    else:
        return -1


======
Write a method: Given an array of integers "intArray", return the second largest number in "intArray".
EX: intArray = [7,5,9,1,3,8,33], return value = 9.
//[10,10,1]
//[9, 10, 1]
def secLar(intArray):
    lar = -1
    secLar = -1
    for i in intArray:
        if i > lar:
            secLar=lar
            lar = i
        if i != lar and i > secLar:
            secLar = i
    return secLar
